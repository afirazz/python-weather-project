# Python Weather Project

This project defines functions which are used to load, process, and summarise weather data. The following Python concepts were used in this project: functions, conditionals, lists, loops, dictionaries, file input/output, and list comprehension.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `convert_date()` | Converts an ISO-formatted date into a human-readable format. |
| `convert_f_to_c()` | Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celcius. |
| `calculate_mean()` | Calculates the mean value from a list of numbers. |
| `load_data_from_csv()` | Reads a csv file and stores the data in a list. |
| `find_min()` | Calculates the minimum value in a list of numbers and also returns its position in the list. |
| `find_max()` | Calculates the maximum value in a list of numbers and also returns its position in the list. |
| `generate_summary()` | Outputs a multi-day summary for the given weather data. |
| `generate_daily_summary()` | Outputs a daily summary for the given weather data. |

This project was completed as the assignment for the Python module in the She Codes Plus program 2024-2025.
